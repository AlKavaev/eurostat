\abstract{Governmental institutions are increasingly
opening up their data resources for the public as open data. This is
providing novel opportunities for research and citizen science, but
efficient tools to access and analyze these data sets are needed to
realize the full potential of the new information resources. We
introduce the \CRANpkg{eurostat} R package that provides a suite of
tools to access open data from Eurostat, including functions to
search, download, and manipulate Eurostat data in an automated and
reproducible manner. The online documentation provides detailed
examples on how to access, summarize and visualize these
spatio-temporal data sets. The package expands previous related work
and has been extensively tested by the user community. This
contributes to the growing ecosystem of R packages that provide
algorithmic tools for reproducible computational research in social
science and humanities.}

Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, is providing a rich
collection of European level demographic and economic data through its
open data service, which currently includes over 8800 data sets on
European demography, economics, health, infrastructure, traffic and
other topics. In many cases the statistics are available with great
geographical resolution and as time series spanning over several years
or decades.

The availability of tools to access and analyse data collections from
the public domain can greatly benefit reproducible
research \citep{Gandrud13, Boettiger2015}. When the data resources and
analysis algorithms are openly available, the complete analytical
workflow spanning from raw data to the final publication can be made
fully automated and transparent. Standardization of common data
analysis tasks via dedicated software packages can help to automate
the analysis workflow, greatly facilitating reproducibility and code
sharing, and making the data analysis more efficient. At the same
time, the algorithms need to be customized for variations in data
formats, access details, and typical use cases.

Here, we introduce the \CRANpkg{eurostat} R package that implements R
tools specifically designed to facilitate such automated access to
open data from
Eurostat\footnote{\url{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database}}. A
dedicated R package for eurostat open data has been missing. The
eurostat R package introduced here brings together the efforts from
our CRAN packages \CRANpkg{statfi} \citep{statfi}
and \CRANpkg{smarterpoland}
\citep{smarterpoland}. Compared to this earlier work, we have combined the
relevant parts of these two packages and implemented an expanded set
of tools with a specific focus on the Eurostat data collection. The
first version of the new \CRANpkg{eurostat} package was released in
CRAN in 2014. It has been actively developed by several contributors
and based on community feedback in Github. We are now reporting the
first mature version of the package that has been improved and tested
by multiple users. The package and its predecessors have been applied
in several case studies by us and others\footnote{See
e.g. http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/04/financial-times-tracks-unemployment-with-r.html}.

Related work includes the \CRANpkg{datamart} \citep{datamart} and the
\CRANpkg{quandl}
\citep{quandl} R packages that provide generic tools that can be used to access
certain versions of Eurostat data. In contrast to these generic
database packages, our eurostat package provides functionality that is
particularly tailored for the Eurostat open data service. The
development version of another related R package
\pkg{reurostat}\footnote{https://github.com/Tungurahua/reurostat} does not seem to be actively maintained at the moment.
Moreover, our \CRANpkg{eurostat} package depends, imports or suggests
the following external R packages:
\CRANpkg{devtools} \citep{devtools}, \CRANpkg{dplyr} \citep{dplyr},
\CRANpkg{knitr} \citep{knitr}, \CRANpkg{ggplot2} \citep{ggplot2},
\CRANpkg{mapproj} \citep{mapproj}, \CRANpkg{plotrix} \citep{plotrix},
\CRANpkg{reshape2} \citep{reshape2}, \CRANpkg{rmarkdown}
\citep{rmarkdown}, \CRANpkg{stringi} \citep{stringi},
\CRANpkg{testthat} \citep{testthat}, and \CRANpkg{tidyr}
\citep{tidyr}. The \CRANpkg{eurostat} R package is
part of rOpenGov collection
\citep{Lahti13icml} that provides reproducible research tools for
computational social science and digital humanities.

In summary, the \CRANpkg{eurostat} package provides custom tools to
search, retrieve, modify and visualize data from the Eurostat open
data service. The package supports key features such as data cache,
date formatting, and tidy data principles \citep{wickham2014} using
the the \CRANpkg{tidyr} R package \citep{tidyr}. Here, we provide an
overview of the core functionality in the current CRAN release version
(1.2.1). For further examples, see the package
vignette\footnote{https://github.com/rOpenGov/eurostat/}.


\section{Search and download commands}

To install and load the CRAN release version, just type in R:

\begin{example}
> install.packages("eurostat")
> library("eurostat")
\end{example}

The complete table of contents of the database can be browsed
on-line\footnote{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database}, or
downloaded in R with the command \code{toc <- get\_eurostat\_toc()}. The function \code{search\_eurostat()} is used
to make a more focused search over the table of contents. To retrieve
data for 'Modal split of passenger transport', for instance, use:

\begin{example}
> query <- search_eurostat("Modal split of passenger transport", type = "table")
\end{example}

The \code{type} argument limits the search on a selected data set type
in the above example. The options for this argument
include \dfn{'table'}, \dfn{'dataset'} or \dfn{'folder'}, referring to
different levels of hierarchy in the data organization: a \code{table}
resides in \code{dataset}, which is in turn stored in a
\code{folder}.

Values in the \code{code} column of the \code{search\_eurostat()}
function output provide data sets identifiers that can be used in
subsequent download commands. Alternatively, these identifier codes
can be browsed at the Eurostat open data service; check the codes in
the Data Navigation Tree listed after each dataset in parentheses. Let
us look at the data set identifier and title for the first entry of
the query data:

\begin{example}
> query$code[[1]]
[1] "tsdtr210"

> query$title[[1]]
[1] "Modal split of passenger transport"
\end{example}


Let us next retrieve the data set with this identifier as follows:

\begin{example}
> dat <- get_eurostat(id = "tsdtr210", time_format = "num")
\end{example}

As the original data is annual in this example, we have selected a
numeric time format. This is more convient for annual time series than
the default date format. The data sets are provided as standard data
frames to support standard tools for data subsetting and
reshaping. The above function call returns a table on transport
statistics.  The first lines of the output are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:getdatatable}.

\begin{table}[ht!]

\end{tabular}
\caption{The output from \code{get\_eurostat()} (Table~\ref{tab:getdatatable}), now converted into human-readable labels by \code{label\_eurostat()}.}
\label{tab:getdatatable2}
\end{table}


\section{Utilities}

Many entries in Table~\ref{tab:getdatatable} are not readily
interpretable, but a simple call \code{label\_eurostat(dat)} converts
the original identifier codes into human-readable versions (shown in
Table~\ref{tab:getdatatable2}) based on translations in the Eurostat
database.

The downloaded data sets are stored in cache by default to avoid
repeated downloads of identical data sets. This can speed up the
analysis. Storing an exact copy of the retrieved raw data on the hard
disk supports also the reproducibility when the source database is
constantly updated.

The transport data set in the above example includes three classes of
vehicles. Three-dimensional data sets such as this can be conveniently
visualized as triangular maps by using
the \CRANpkg{plotrix} \citep{plotrix} package.

\begin{example}
# Select data for the year 2012:
> dats <- subset(dat, time == 2012,
>	   select = c(geo, vehicle, values))

# Transform into countries x vehicles matrix and remove NAs
> library(knitr)
> transports <- tidyr::spread(dats, vehicle, values)
> transports <- na.omit(transports)

# Triangle plot
> library(plotrix)
> plotrix::triax.plot(transports[, c("BUS_TOT", "CAR", "TRN")],
>            show.grid = TRUE, 
>            label.points = TRUE, point.labels = transports$geo, 
>            pch = 19)
\end{example}

The Figure~\ref{fig:transport}A illustrates the resulting triangular
visualization showing the distribution of vehicle types in different
countries. Interestingly, the Eurostat data also reveals a decreasing
trend of road accidents in many countries over time
(Figure~\ref{fig:transport}B). The Eurostat database includes a
variety of demographic and health indicators. We see, for instance,
that overweight varies remarkably across different age groups
quantified by the body-mass index (BMI) (Figure~\ref{fig:bmi}).

\section{Geospatial information}

\subsection{Map visualizations}

The indicators in the Eurostat open data service are typically
available as annual time series grouped by country, and sometimes at
more refined temporal or geographic levels. Eurostat provides
complementary geospatial data on the corresponding administrative
statistical units to support visualizations at the appropriate
geographic resolution. The geospatial data sets are available as
standard
shapefiles\footnote{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units}. As
an example, let us look at disposable income of private households
(data set identifier
tgs00026\footnote{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/TGS00026}). This
information is provided at the geographic level of NUTS2 regions. This
is the intermediate level of territorial units in the Eurostat
regional classifications, and roughly corresponds to provinces or
states in each
country\footnote{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview}
(Figure~\ref{fig:mapexample}). The
example demonstrates how the Eurostat data sets and geospatial data,
retrieved with the eurostat package, can be combined with additional
visualization tools and other utilities including
\CRANpkg{grid} \citep{grid}, \CRANpkg{maptools} \citep{maptools}, \CRANpkg{rgdal} \citep{rgdal},
\CRANpkg{rgeos} \citep{rgeos}, \CRANpkg{scales} \citep{scales}, and
\CRANpkg{stringr} \citep{stringr}.

\begin{figure}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{2015-manu-mapexample-1}
\caption{Disposable income of private households across NUTS2-level national regions in European countries visualized based on geospatial data available from Eurostat.}
\label{fig:mapexample}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Default country groupings}

To facilitate further analysis and visualization of standard European
country groups, we have included ready-made country code lists. The
list of EFTA countries is retrieved, for instance, with:

\begin{example}
data(efta_countries)
\end{example}


This provides the EFTA country listing in
Table~\ref{tab:efta}. Similar lists are available for Euro area
(ea\_countries), EU (eu\_countries) and the EU candidate countries
(candidate\_countries). These auxiliary data sets facilitate the
selection of specific country groups in the analysis. The full name
and a two-letter identifier are provided for each country as provided
by the Eurostat database. The country codes follow the ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 standard, except that GB and GR are replaced by UK (United
Kingdom) and EL (Greece) in the Eurostat database,
respectively. Linking these country codes with external data sets can
be facilitated by conversions between different country coding
standards with the \CRANpkg{countrycode} package \citep{countrycode}.

\begin{tabular}{rll}
\toprule
  \hline
  & code & name \\ 
  \hline
  1 & IS & Iceland \\ 
  2 & LI & Liechtenstein \\ 
  3 & NO & Norway \\ 
  4 & CH & Switzerland \\ 
   \hline
\bottomrule   
\end{tabular}
\caption{The EFTA country listing from the eurostat R package.}

\end{table}




\section{Summary}

The \CRANpkg{eurostat} R package provides convenient tools to access open data
from Eurostat. Combining programmatic access to the data sets with
further analysis and visualization tools allows a seamless and
reproducible automation of the complete data analytical workflow from
accessing the raw data to statistical analysis and final
publication. The source code and installation instructions for the
latest development version of the eurostat package are available at
the github site, as well as the full source code of the figures and
tables of this manuscript\footnote{https://github.com/rOpenGov/eurostat},
where the Rmarkdown document provides reproducible documentation with
full algorithmic details on the analyses, and can be updated when new
versions of the Eurostat data become available.

The eurostat package provides one example of automated data retrieval
from institutional data repositories, featuring options such as
search, subsetting and cache. Possible future extensions and
improvements include implementation of specific data representation
formats to harmonize the data representation across similar data
sources and to facilitate subsequent tool development. In particular,
we should take further advantage of the existing spatiotemporal data
structures available in R, such as those provided by
the \CRANpkg{spacetime} package \citep{spacetime}, and construct
wrapper functions to speed up routine operations such as visualizing
the temporal and geospatial data sets from Eurostat. The package
source code can be freely used, modified and distributed under the
BSD-2-clause (modified FreeBSD) license. We welcome issues, bug
reports and other feedback.
